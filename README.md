Windows updates are most easily installed using the **Windows Update** service. While you could certainly download updates manually from Microsoft's servers, updating via Windows Update is considerably easier to do.

The **Windows Update** service has changed over the years as Microsoft released new versions of Windows. While **Windows Updates** used to be installed by visiting the Windows Update website, newer versions of Windows include a special built-in Windows Update feature with more options.

## What Is Windows Update Used For?

**Windows Update** is used to keep Microsoft Windows and several other Microsoft programs updated.

Updates often include feature enhancements and security updates to protect Windows from malware and malicious attacks.

You can also use Windows Update to access the update history that shows all the updates that have been installed to the computer through the Windows Update service.

## Where to find Windows Update in Windows 10? 

In Windows 10, **Windows Update** is available through the Settings app. Open the Settings app (press Windows + I on your keyboard) and then go to Update & Security.

Then you should see the **Windows Update** page from the Settings app. If you do not, make sure that Windows Update is selected in the column on the left side of the window.

An alternative way of getting to the Windows Update settings in Windows 10 is to use the search. Type update in the search field on your taskbar, and then click or tap the **"Windows Update settings"** search result. This should take you straight to the **Windows Update page** from the Settings app.
